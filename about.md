Dyvil is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM.
Specifically, it can be classified as strongly typed, object-oriented and parallel, with functional and imperative elements and dynamic typing support.
Dyvil extends Java with several new and modern language features. It is in a pre-release stage of development, but steadily updated and extended.
New releases are published usually twice a month; nightly builds are available for every commit.

This blog covers summaries for new releases as well as in-depth details about special design or implementation problems.
It is maintained by Clashsoft and updated about once a month.
